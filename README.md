## Prerequisites

To use this template, you will need a LaTeX distribution installed on your computer or using an online editor like Overleaf. We recommend using **Overleaf**, or one of the following editors, MiKTeX on Windows, MacTeX on Mac, or TeX Live on Linux.

In addition use `XeLaTex` to compile the project, and you will need to install the packages mentioned in `ukhthesis.cls`. If you are using Overleaf, these packages should be automatically installed when you compile the document.


## Customization

The template can be customized with your own information and content by modifying the fields used in each file. You can also add your own chapters, sections, and subsections by using the `\chapter{}`, `\section{}`, and `\subsection{}` commands, respectively.


## Sample Document

The `main.tex` file included in this repository demonstrates how to use the template and includes examples of common elements such as equations, figures, tables, and images.


## References

To manage your references, use the `\cite{}` command to cite sources within the text.

The template is set up to use the `natbib` package, which allows you to use BibTeX (.bib) files to store your references. To use this feature, create a `.bib` file and include it in the template. Then, use the `\cite{}` command to cite sources from the `.bib` file. References have the Harvard referencing style.


## Contact

If you have any questions or run into any issues while using the template, please don't hesitate to contact the maintainers or open an issue on the repository. We'll be happy to help!
